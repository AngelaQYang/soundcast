PSRC's Activity-Based Travel Model

## Overview

Soundcast is a collection of statistical models used by the Puget Sound Regional Council to forecast regional travel around the Puget Sound area of Washington state. The model includes several different components to estimate details of travel choices over time. This User's Guide focuses on practical steps to implement Soundcast, but more technical details are available from [PSRC's website](http://www.psrc.org/assets/11924/SoundCastDesign2014.pdf)
